# SmoothScrolling
Allows for smooth, single page scrolling using jQuery.

How does it work?

When you click on one of links of the navigation bar, this smooth scroller grabs the value of the href, matches it to the corresponding section id, and automatically scrolls the window at a specified speed to the beginning of that section. There is also added functionality for scrolling back to the top of the page using an image.

As you scroll through the page, it will automtically show which link is "active" as you scroll through each section.
